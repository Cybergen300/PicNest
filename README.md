# PicNest

In this repository you'll find the current code for this project aiming to create a decentralized instagram clone. Note: This project being still under development the code will change over time.

Go check this link to see the current development state : https://cybergen.jimdofree.com/blockchain/blockchain-project/picnest/

Update : If you have metamask on your web browser you can now access directly the Dapp on the Kovan network at this address : https://picnest.herokuapp.com/

However if you have already a basic blockchain dev environment :

    metamask account
    Node.js
    truffle
    Infura
    Ganache
    
I'll make sure that at any time you're able to run the Dapp locally on your default browser by following these 3 easy steps :

    open console
    run "npm install"
    run "truffle migrate --reset"
    run "npm start"

n.b. Don't forget to open Ganache and set up your Metamask account on local dev at first as the migration we'll be done by default on the local env.
